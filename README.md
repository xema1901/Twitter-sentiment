# HATE SPEECH MODERATION ON TWITTER

## Overview 
This project is to develop a prototype solution that is based on simple sentiment analysis techniques to identify and block hate speech on Twitter, allowing an atmosphere that's non-toxic for users, as well as mitigating the skewness arising out of any violent form of communication during the 2020 US elections. 

## The Problem
With the advent of social media platforms like Twitter in the past decade, individuals inclined towards racism, misogyny or homophobia have found an opportunity to reinforce their views on others who are not inclined to their beliefs. Internet culture often categorizes online hate speech as “trolling,” but the severity and viciousness of these comments has evolved into something much more sinister in recent years.

Across the United States, the inflammatory and confrontational tone of political rhetoric is creeping into public discourse and polarizing the electorate. It has created massive skew in the US elections in the past. Therefore, it's critical to block hate speech to reduce the skewness. 

## The Solution
This solution has been built as a prototype to identify hate speech related to 2016 US elections, the same can be extended to block hate speeches during the 2020 US elections to avoid any skew arising out of any violent form of communication.
